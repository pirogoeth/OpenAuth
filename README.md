OpenAuth
========
* * *

OpenAuth is an open, light, and extensible minecraft server authentication 
plugin for Bukkit.

There's not much (and by not much, we mean a SHIT LOAD) work done on it so far, but that's going to change very soon (already has...). 
(There is actually a lot of work done on it now)

Most useful docs and the ({NOT} always updated) roadmap will be available at http://phabricator.maio.me/project/view/6
