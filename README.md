OpenAuth
========
* * *

OpenAuth is an open, light, and extensible minecraft server authentication 
plugin for Bukkit.

We've finally (officially) released OpenAuth!

You can find some information about it at [BukkitDev][bd], or, you can read most of what is already on BukkitDev at the [OpenAuth Wiki][wiki], or you can view the project feed on [Phabricator][phab].

All commits are automatically built by the [Integrity CI][integrity].  All builds for OpenAuth can be accessed [here][norm] and all promoted builds are listen [here][prom]. (Note: promoted builds are builds that are more stable than the builds you may get from the main project page.  All promoted builds will be uploaded to BukkitDev, as promoted builds are more tested, more complete, and work better.
